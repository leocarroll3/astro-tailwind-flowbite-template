  "Your property is unique; the layout, the terrain, the elevation, even  the soil. It's only reasonable that you may have questions about your fence installation. We're happy to share  our industry knowledge and local Upstate experience with you. Because your project is more than just a job to us- it's an opportunity to share our passion for the art & craft of fence construction. And to share our great experiences working with homeowners and HOAs all over Spartanburg County.";
